                Hi everyone, I'm Filip, a software developer from <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Belgrade" class="blog-link-content">Belgrade, the capital of Serbia</a>. I was born on March 6, 1986, in Belgrade, making me 38 years old. Growing up in the analog age, before the rise of commercial internet, I was always fascinated by the digital world. I dreamed of understanding how it all worked, but the limited information and development at that time made it difficult.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I watched older kids with their 286, 386, and 486 computers and longed for one of my own. In 1998, when I was in fifth grade of Elementary School, I got my first computer, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium" target="_blank" class="blog-link-content">Pentium</a>. I was overjoyed and immediately dove into video games and writing word documents. I remember the first ones was "Civilization" and "Championship Manager". My parents regularly gave me tasks to type and format word documents for them. In the same year I started playing basketball and competing in younger categories (I earned my first medal in 2001). That how I found another passion that continues to this day. I experienced the internet for the first time a year later. It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access" target="_blank" class="blog-link-content">Dial-up internet</a>, using a telephone line and audio signals for data transmission. This system was quite inefficient, taking a long time to connect, data packet loss, frequently dropping connections due to phone calls...
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I went to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cetvrta%20gimnazija" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank"> 4th Belgrade Gymnasium School</a>. My direction was natural sciences and the most successful subjects were mathematics, logic and sports. This is where I encountered programming for the first time. The first programming languages ​​I met were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Pascal</a>. Here I met a lot of good people and many of them are now my friends. Events and anecdotes continue to be told. At that time, there were popular PC gaming rooms where we often went and played in LAN. We even created our own virtual servers via dial up and played from home. I mostly played Warcraft, Counter Strike, Dota and Pro Evolution Soccer. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After finishing high school, I entered the Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering in Belgrade. I passed the entrance exam in Mathematics without any mistakes with the maximum number of points. I would throw the next two years into oblivion. Puberty left me without passing the exam and I decided to leave college. But there is something good in every experience. I decided to enroll in a new college and choose a new profession. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In 2007 I entered <a href="https://eng.singidunum.ac.rs/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Singidunum University,</a> Faculty of Business and Informatics (later renamed in <a href="https://fir.singidunum.ac.rs/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Faculty of Informatics and Computing</a>). I have chosen the programming and design direction. I studied various subjects, but the most relevant are Basics of Programming, Java, Web programming, Databases, Economics, Business, Management, Math, Statistic... At the same time, I joined the basketball team and represented my university at various sports tournaments in the largest European cities. I brought a lot of medals and made new friends from these competitions. 
                I graduated in 2012 and earned the <b>"Bachelor's Degree of Business Informatics"</b>. My graduation thesis was Java application for calculating stats in a basketball game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later I started a start up business with 3 friends. We were engaged in the creation of websites, but we were not profitable and closed the business after 6 months.
                In 2015, I attended a swift programming course. the course lasted four months. During that time, I did several mini-projects and one of them in a team with colleagues was uploaded to the apple store.
                After completing the course, I got a job at Company called "Digital Share" and worked as a Swift developer for 1 year.
                After that I started doing web development for a detective agency. I have created several sites for this agency <a target="_blank" href="https://detektivskaagencija.rs/" class="blog-link-content">detektivskaagencija.rs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://privatnidetektiv.rs/" class="blog-link-content">privatnidetektiv.rs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poligrafcentar.rs/" class="blog-link-content"> poligrafcentar.rs</a>. In addition to development, I also did SEO optimization and presence on social networks. These sites are still ranked first for selected keywords. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, I started my own project with the aim of taking my thesis from the university to a higher level and learning new technologies. For the frontend I chose a single page application using <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">React js</a> <b>(CreateReactApp)</b>, for the backend <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Node js</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Express js</a>, and the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a> platform for managing databases, authentication and more.
                This project is currently paused, but I plan to finish it and publish in the future. After the detective agency, I attended professional practice for 3 months. Practice was done remotely in a team of several people. The platform we worked on was <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" class="blog-link-content" target="_blank">React Native</a>. We were making a mobile application and everyone had their own tasks. We used github for source control.
            </p>
            <p>
                In August 2021, I started working on projects as a freelancer for the weblab group company. I Developed web application from scratch using HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. After finishing this project I Developed a mobile application from scratch using React Native. In addition I Integrated third-party services, such as Google Places API, Media
                Wiki, Weather API to provide additional functionality for users
            </p>
            <p><b>
                From all this you can conclude that I have had the opportunity to work in various areas of software development. Although I would assign myself the most in the area of ​​web development, I think I could adapt quickly in other areas of Information Technology. I am currently ready for employment or work on projects. If you think I can help your business, send me a message to the email address filip1986babic@gmail.com or through this website and you will surely receive a reply as soon as possible.

                All the best, Filip &#128512;
